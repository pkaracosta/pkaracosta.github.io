My name is Petroula. I am originally from Thessaloniki (GR) and currently live in Copenhagen (DK). I am a Computational Physicist, working as a Research Assistant at the X-ray and Neutron Science Group at Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen.

<!-- These days I am doing simulations, data analysis and machine learning. -->
I have a B.Sc. in Physics from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. I did [my Bachelor's Thesis](https://ikee.lib.auth.gr/record/321428/files/Karakosta.pdf) on Computational Bioelectromagnetism.

I also have a M.Sc. in Computational Physics from the University of Copenhagen, where I did [my Master's Thesis](https://nbi.ku.dk/english/theses/masters-theses/petroula-karakosta/) on simulations of Neutron Scattering experiments and Machine Learning. 

[Here is my CV](/files/my_cv.pdf)
